# My Personal Development Resume

Welcome!  I have put toghether this simple page to showcase some of my many interests and projects.  Unfortunately, some of the more interesting and difficult projects I have been involved with are not mine to share and therefore will not be shown on this page.  I will, over time, attempt to extract some of the more elegant coding aspects of those projects and boil them down into examples to post here.
